<h3>Bitcoin Charts</h3>

## General info and backstory
This was the first project I ever created with no tutorials - just a buddy and myself creating a game together.

* This is a flappy bird knock-off, but with a different theme.

* The music was created by another friend of ours.

* The project was available on the Google Play Store for some time, but got removed due to a change in their terms of service. 

* It was never meant to be revolutionary. It was literally just to create a tangible product with no help from any tutorials. 

* The program was originally created for Android devices, but was later ported to a pc version as well as a port to webGL, which enabled us to play it in browsers. 

## Project is created with:
* Unity 2018 (game engine)
* Android Studio (mobile version)
* WebGL (browser version)
